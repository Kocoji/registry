Congratulated! Your registry server is hosted at:
http{{ if $.Values.registry.tls.enabled }}s{{ end }}://{{ $.Values.registry.host | default "registry.local" }}

You have to update your Hosts/DNS to make it works.

After that, you can now use: docker login {{ $.Values.registry.host | default "registry.local" }} 
then push a new image to it. Cheers
